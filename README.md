*myDietFriend* is an app that allows you to take a charge of your health by allowing to visualize your quality of your meals and frequency of your workouts. Users can input their meals and log grams of each macronutrient (protein, carb, and fats) in each food item. The user is also able to log their daily workouts/activities. Daily goals are also used as a set point to track the user’s progress.

## Next steps🧊
- [ ] AAU I will be able to better view my  progress on a tracker that implements a data visualization tool. The tracker references my goals, meals, and workout inputs.
- [ ] Use 3rd party API (potentially Nutritionx API) to allow user to simply look up macros of food items by inputting food name and serving size or even scanning barcode instead of manually logging the protein, fats, and carbs.
